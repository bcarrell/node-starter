node-starter
============

This is a starter template that I use to bootstrap new Node applications.

The stack I normally use consists of Gulp for task management, Express as my
web stack with Swig for templating, SCSS for stylesheets, and Browserify to
bundle all of my front-end code.

This stack might work for you, but I make no considerations for that.
